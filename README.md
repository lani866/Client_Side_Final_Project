Fashion News Explorer 
A simple, client-side web application that fetches and displays the latest fashion news by category using the NewsAPI.org service and D3.js.

//Current Implementation//

For demonstration, the NewsAPI key is hard-coded in the JavaScript file under the constant NEWSAPI_KEY in index.html (or script.js).

//Instructions to Replace the Key//

1. Open index.html (or script.js if you moved the code).

2. Locate the line:

    const NEWSAPI_KEY = 'a80576b7a86d4cc785e1535f229cad42';//

3. Replace the placeholder string with your own NewsAPI.org key.

    const NEWSAPI_KEY = '<YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY_HERE>';
